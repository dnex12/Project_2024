                <p>In the world of luxury sports cars, Italy reigns supreme. But in Italy, the Pagani Huayra R takes the checkered flag. This car has the perfect trifecta of performance – the immense power of a V12-R 850hp engine, lightweight composite design, and aerodynamic engineering. There were only 30 of these cars ever made as 1:1 editions, but we’re bringing it to our RLC members in this new casting, sure to be a centerpiece of any Hot Wheels collection. </p>

                <p>Our RLC Exclusive McLaren F1 pays tribute to the vision of a driving force built for serious hustle. This recreation rocks electric dark orange Spectraflame paint and butterfly doors. It’s a casting loaded with premium touches, including the trim, lights, badging, interior, painted matte silver wheels, and of course the engine. The ultra-detailed RLC McLaren F1 may be just 1:64 scale, but it will command your entire shelf.</p>

                <h3>RLC Exclusive Nissan Skyline GT-R BNR34</h3>
                
                <p>The Nissan Skyline GT-R BNR34 is the 5th generation in the GT-R series. Nissan’s GTRs already had a dominant reputation in the racing world, and the BNR34 sped into the scene ready to make its own mark. Improved aerodynamics due to body rigidity amped up its performance while taking nothing away from its stand-out style. Our Hot Wheels version features stunning chameleon paint that shifts colors in the light, and a ‘PURP’ license plate nodding to the awesome overall color of the car.</p>

                <h3>RLC Exclusive Magnus Walker “Urban Outlaw” Porsche 964</h3>
                <p>Famed fashion and automobile designer Magnus Walker has a special affinity for Porsche. His 964 designs have been nothing short of epic, and our recreation is no exception. With body mods differentiating it from a stock Porsche, a Spectraflame mint green paint job, and metallic gold graphics, it’s bound to turn heads. We even recreated a sage green interior with authentic plaid seat detail and specially designed Real Riders fifteen52 Outlaw wheels with gold hubs to bring Magnus’s authentic designs to 1:64 scale.</p>

                <h3>RLC Exclusive 1986 Porsche 959</h3>
                <p>For Porsche’s 75th anniversary, we’re retooling the legendary 1986 Porsche 959. Featuring an opening rear hood to show off the sequential twin-turbo flat-six engine, this car looks ready to tear up the blacktop. Our version features a Spectraflame true black exterior and red-and-black interior to emulate the coveted Porsche “Komfort” package. This classic Porsche is a must-have for any Hot Wheels collection.</p>

                <h3>RLC Exclusive 1991 BMW M3</h3>
                <p>As the ultimate performance automobile, the 1991 BMW M3 won its share of trophies in touring car races – including the 24 Hours Nürburgring. In 1991 alone, this German sportscar graced four of the winner’s circles across various races. Our classic ride features opening doors, red Spectraflame paint and silver & gold VUM wheels. This BMW is sure to turn heads whether it’s parked or racing by.</p>

                <h3>RLC Exclusive 1986 Porsche 959</h3>
                <p>One of the first sports cars with all-wheel drive, the Porsche 959 paved the way for the future of sports cars. It needed the traction because of its speedy twin turbocharged engine. 

                    Our designers remained true to the spirit of this superstar supercar with an innovation for Hot Wheels. “The Porsche 959 has a staggered track width,” says Brendon Vetuskey, “meaning the rear wheels sit farther apart than the front wheels do.” This new casting also features an opening rear hood, exposing a detailed engine. </p>
